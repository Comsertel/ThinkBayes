    "A statistical statement appeared in The Guardian on Friday January 4, 2002:\n",
    "\n",
    "When spun on edge 250 times, a Belgian one-euro coin came up heads 140 times and tails 110. “It looks very suspicious to me,” said Barry Blight, a statistics lecturer at the London School of Economics. “If the coin were unbiased, the chance of getting a result as extreme as that would be less than 7%.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But do these data give evidence that the coin is biased rather than fair?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer that question, we’ll proceed in two steps. First we’ll use the binomial distribution to see where that 7% came from; then we’ll use Bayes’s theorem to estimate the probability that this coin comes up heads."
